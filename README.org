Projects for practicing skills and techniques in different languages

* Overview

  In /Clean Coder/ it is suggested to practice your craft (and what
  you do at work does not count).  This is an archive of my practice
  code and projects that I use or collect over time for this process.

* Directory Structure

  - README.org: This file.
  - PROJECTA: Directory containing project A.
    + PROJECTA.org: Description file for PROJECTA.  Contains notes,
      references, suggested reading, state of the current
      implementation, and so on.
    + lang1: Implementation of PROJECTA in the lang1 language.
  - lib: Library files used throughout the projects (for example, a
    common unit testing framework).
  - bin: Common scripts used throughout the projects.
